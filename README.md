# Netherending Ores

### Overview
Just a simple mod to add ores and furnace conversion recipes to the Nether and the End.

### Ore Generation
Other mods such as CoFH World will be needed to control the ore spawning.\
Nether ore generation is based off the settings for the last release of the Nether Ores mod by skyboy026/powercrystals for MC 1.7.10 with minor changes, including adding ores that never existed in that mod.\
The End uses similar settings to the Nether but reduced size/count as the height range of naturally generated End Stone is far less.

### Recipes
The furnace recipes to smelt the nether/end ores to 2x the closest ore dictionary matching ore.\
Ores which do not originate in the Overworld, act like silk touched versions of their overworld ores recipe wise, this is done for balance.\
